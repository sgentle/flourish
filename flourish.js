  Flourish
  ========

  Flourish is an epicyclic music visualiser. It takes the core concept of
  Fourier analysis, that any signal can be represented as a sum of cycles, and
  uses it to construct a spiral made out of the relationships between the
  frequencies in music.

  If you just want to see it in action, here's
  [Flourish](https://demos.samgentle.com/flourish). If you want to know more,
  read on!

  The code has three essential building blocks:

  * Audio, which takes input from the microphone and transforms it into a
    frequency spectrum using the Web Audio API
  * Spiral, which turns that frequency spectrum into a spiral shape that we can plot
  * Canvas, which plots the spiral on the screen

/*
  Audio
  -----

  The Audio code sets up an audio context, handles the getUserMedia dance, and
  acts as a little wrapper for AnalyserNode so we can get FFTs out.

      latencyHint: 'interactive',

/*
  Spiral
  ------

  The Spiral is created from our FFT data. The whole spectrum would allow us to
  reconstruct the signal in perfect detail, but we just want the most important
  bits. So, we take the frequency data and only use the top K values â€“ those
  with the greatest contribution to the final signal. We also apply some
  thresholding, mostly for performance.

  Web Audio gives us values in dB, so we undo that to get the unscaled power
  values back. We also halve all the frequencies so that we get a one-sided spiral
  instead of a symmetric figure.

  For scaling, we also keep track of the decibel value of the loudest frequency.
*/

      ratio: d.i / 2,
      power: 10**(d.v/20),
    }))

  }

/*
  getPoint is a parametric equation that turns values from 0->1 into coordinates
  along the spiral by adding up all the frequencies at that point. It returns
  values in an arbitrary range (depending on `power`), so we scale it later.

  Canvas

  `draw` handles iterating through the points of the spiral, scaling them, and
  drawing them to the canvas.

  We use `p0`, which will always be the largest point of the spiral, to scale
  the spiral to a uniform size. We then offset it vertically so that it
  "grows" up from the bottom of the screen.

  We apply two scaling factors based on the audio's volume:

  * `size` scales `getPoint`'s *output*, making the spiral larger or smaller.
  * `extent` scales `getPoint`'s *input*, making the spiral shorter or longer.

  Together, these give the visualisation its characteristic unfurling movement.
